Requirements

•	Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on the conversion between intergalactic units and roman numerals. You are expected to handle invalid queries appropriately.
•	Basic components such as Input/Output processing and business logic core are essential. But please design your application as complete and modular as possible, following a standard software system requirements such as error handling, etc.

•	Well refactor the code to follow good code practices. (Some good relevant resources can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code)
•	Unit/Integration tests covering all the scenarios are good to have to show proper testing skills.

•	Implement your application using Java or Go.

•	Please document clearly about your system design solution (feel free to use professional diagrams if you think necessary), nontrivial assumptions as well as the clear instructions on compiling and invoking the program with program environment details. Proper server setup instructions are also essential if you develop a web application for presenting the results.

•	**NOTE**:

•	Please DO NOT copy the solution online. We have already collected a list of typical solutions online. If we found your work is exactly same with some of them, we may have to terminate the review process.

•	This code challenge is mean to demonstrate your software engineering skills and practice so

Please structure your project code clean and clearly.
